# q-reference-card
a cheat sheet for Kx systems Q product which I've been using lately

I think the latex is some stuff John Earnest did for Kerf; it looked nice and I thought
it was odd that nobody did the same thing for Q.

Please flag any missing bits or ideas for improvement; it's mostly to keep it all in my head 
when I'm heads down on Q bits.
